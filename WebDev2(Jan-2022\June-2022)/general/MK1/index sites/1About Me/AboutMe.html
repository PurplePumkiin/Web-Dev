				<p class="secondHeader">Who Am I</p>
					<p class="text">My name is Dennis, I am a Ohioan who is interested in just about anything technology. My latest interest is in websites and how they actually work, including both front and backend design. As of right now am learning Web Development which includes HTML, CSS, JS, and starting to learning NodeJS.</p>
				<p class="secondHeader">Hobbies</p>
					<p class="text">In my free time I follow pretty much everyone elses basic hobbies. When I get home I typically help out with what ever I'm needed for then load up a game or a movie. I do however have no problem learning something new so long as its interesting to me. Recently I've gotten into Linux opperating systems and their respective command lines. I kind of treat stress as a hobbie, as I'm not affraid to get my hands dirty on a project and find that higher stakes tend to make me work better. <br><br> I have also dabbled in content creation. While I have had youtube channels, I have since deleted them as they never really went anywhere and the effort put into them was just never really worth it, however I still find it interesting and periodically make videos and images for fun.</p>
