					<tr><td class="fillerText">Live! Decided to host this site on the internet. We'll see if this turns out to be good idea or not. I have some projects I need to work on, which I dont know when or if I'll be able to do them. But now all I need to do is the hard stuff, I.e. getting a domain, setting up SSL certification, getting a load server as I plan on running more than just this site, and any other issues that come up. In the spirit of going live I decide to make a bug page to hopefully keep me on my toes and document the process by which I work on the site. Hopefully any would be employers would be pleased to see steady growth in my skills. Ironically however, I have decided to use a site that opens externally rather than in the iFrame due to its first entry, regarding iFrame caching.</td></tr>

					<tr><td class="fillerText">Finally managed to work out most of the bugs. Resizing is fixed, iframe issues are fixed, and the light mode dark mode is fixed but can still be improved. I also finally changed over all the sub links to look proper in the iFrame. I dont know wether or not I'll use the iFrame for everything however, as its not exactly the easiest to use and center things relative to the home page. So I'm thinking this home page, which originally was made to expodite the creation of sites, will no longer serve its original purpose. But who knows, first I have the find a new project to work on.</td></tr>

					<tr><td class="fillerText">Welp, one problem is fixed, another shows up. I fixed some clipping issues by using a new css variable I learned of called z-index. It allows me to change where the elements appear in the z-axis so as to choose which go on top of each other. I also figured out how to make a light mode dark mode button using java script and css thanks to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. However in doing these changes I managed to break the iframe so it no longer opens the left nav bars links in the iframe, but rather in a new tab. So now I get to debug this in class tomorrow.</td></tr>

					<tr><td class="fillerText">The work on the new home page continues, structuring it is basically done, now is a matter of just ironing out the bugs. One of the main ones being overlap from the iFrame that the pages are viewed through and the left nav bar. I made it so the left bar had a minimum width to preserve its look, however the page was being rendered using two different units of measurement, neither communicated or worked together. I didn't think that using min-width would work on the central part of the page as it would just cause the elements to overlap more, however instead it makes it so the site has a minimum size that cannot be broken, rather than causing overlap. The suggestion to use min-width came courtesy of my web dev teacher, his suggestion inspired me to actually try what I wouldn't think would work, which to my surprise, worked perfectly.</td></tr>

					<tr><td class="fillerText">Recently I have been thinking about ways to make the creation of my websites more efficient. Currently I am experimenting with using iFrames to make it easy to make really quick sites and spend more times learning and working on my projects.<br><br>This new home page will also make it easier to find, keep track of, and keep my progression upto date. This new web page will also give new purpose to this home page and make it more interesting. The home page will act as a blog to keep pressure on me to learn new things.</td></tr>
