			<h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>My name is Dennis, I spend all my time learning about anything expcept what I should be learning about as school is boring and the topics we must learn are boring to. As a result when ever I talk to people I constantly get reminded of random factoids and will spend the next hour and half searching the internet trying to find what ever it was that I thought of.</p>
            <h2>Likes/Dislikes?</h2>
            <p>Honestly, most of the time I dont care about a thing you say, that is if I have any idea of what you talking about as I dont watch the news and find out about things way after everyone else. However, if I had to list things that I explicitly like I would have to say setinh up useless tools, from a media server to get my mountains of movies acessable anywhere, to a bot on discord that calls people and idiot at random. But overall, my favorite thing to do, is breaking things, there's just something unique to fixing things, a mixture of stress and intrege as I try to figure out why something isn't working.<br><br>I do however hate it when im told to do thing a certain way when theres no reason to do that in reality. Expecially in math, if my equation works, tehn let me use it, dont keep correcting me.</p>
